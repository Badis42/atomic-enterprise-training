# Atomic Enterprise Platform
Based on the worldâ€™s leading enterprise Linux, Red Hat Atomic Enterprise Platform provides the foundation for production scale container deployments, utilizing the same core enabling technologies as Red Hat [OpenShift Enterprise 3](https://www.openshift.com/products/origin), including [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) as a Linux container format, and [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/) for container orchestration. 

For more information [read the press release](http://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/red-hat-unveils-red-hat-atomic-enterprise-platform-production-deployment-secure-certified-linux-containers-scale).

This guide focuses on Atomic Enterprise Platform.  However, there is
ongoing work to share more work with OpenShift v3, and thus you might
find newer instructions in the [OpenShift
version](https://github.com/openshift/training) of this guide.

## Differences from Openshift v3
The following features are not provided with Atomic Enterprise, but are with OpenShift v3:
- STI (Source-To-Image builder)
- UI (web console)
- Docker Builder

Atomic Enterprise will be introduced with a series of early access releases.
This document provides an overview of the training materials for each release
and what that release covers.

**Work in progress**

## Early Access Program based on Openshift v3
The following is an overview of the Atomic Enterprise (AE) features covered in
Early Access Program training:
- Installation and configuration of AE and atomic-sdn
- Adding nodes to the master
- Extensive command line use
- Basic HTTP/S (only) routing. 
- Work with supplied example applications
- User authentication
- Project quotas (display)
- Complex / Tiered app deployment
- Arbitrary docker image deployment
- Ansible-based installer (non-interactive)
- Improvements and enhancements in the CLI
- "Regions" and "Zones"
- Quota enforcement
- Templates from the console
- Beginnings of user/team management
- Internal service DNS
- Expanded documentation/explanations
- Integrated sdn into OpenShift
  - No separate openshift-sdn-node and openshift-sdn-master packages or services
    You should remove openshift-sdn-master and openshift-sdn-node packages or
    preferably reprovision your environment when installing Beta 4
  - Openvswitch based implementation provided via 'openshift-sdn-ovs' plugin
    package and configuring `networkPluginName: redhat/openshift-ovs-subnet` on
    master and nodes. Ansible does this for you by default.
